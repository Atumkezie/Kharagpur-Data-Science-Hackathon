The story begins in the small town of Devgarh, where a curious boy named Arjun lived near the riverbank.
He loved solving puzzles, asking questions, and understanding how the world worked.
One evening, he noticed strange symbols drawn on the sand, which turned out to be a coded map.

Arjun and his best friend Meera decoded the symbols and followed the map to the abandoned hill fort of Kalinjar.
Inside the fort, they found a locked stone door with a puzzle:
"Only truth opens the path. The sum of the prime stars guides the key."

They observed 8 stars and mapped them to the first 8 prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.
They calculated the sum → 77.
Arjun entered 77 into the stone lock and the door opened.

A hidden AI reasoning orb appeared with a message:
"If you reached here, you reason wisely. Build systems that think, not just speak."

Arjun said: "AI should read long stories, remember them, find evidence, apply logic, and answer wisely."
Meera agreed and they decided to use the orb for helping people logically.

They returned to Devgarh by sunrise, carrying knowledge and logic as the real treasure.
