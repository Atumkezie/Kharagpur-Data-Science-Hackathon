The story begins in the small town of Devgarh, where a curious boy named Arjun lived near the riverbank. 
He loved solving puzzles, asking questions, and understanding how the world worked. 
One evening, while returning from school, he noticed strange patterns drawn on the wet sand—symbols he had never seen before.

Arjun called his best friend Meera, who was equally intelligent and loved decoding hidden messages. 
They spent hours studying the symbols, comparing them to ancient scripts, and finally realized that it was a coded map.

The map pointed toward the abandoned hill fort of Kalinjar, a place locals feared due to mysterious legends. 
But Arjun and Meera believed in logic, not fear. 
They packed a notebook, torch, rope, and Meera also carried her self-built compass device.

At midnight, they began the climb. 
The path was steep, covered with vines, and filled with old carvings on the stones. 
Arjun kept taking notes and found that the carvings were aligned mathematically with the stars above.

Inside the fort, they found a locked stone door with a number puzzle engraved:
"Only truth opens the path. The sum of the prime stars guides the key."

Meera whispered, "Prime stars matlab? Ho sakta hai prime numbers linked to stars positions!"  
Arjun agreed and quickly listed the first few primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19…

They observed 8 stars forming a visible pattern from the fort window. 
Mapping them to the prime list, they calculated the sum → **77**.  
Arjun entered 77 into the stone lock… and the door opened.

A hidden library appeared, filled with scrolls, machines, and a holographic message:
"If you reached here, you reason wisely. Build systems that think, not just speak."

They found a mechanical AI orb that activated when spoken to. 
Arjun asked, "Knowledge ka purpose kya hai?"  
Orb replied, "To reason, retrieve truth, and generate wisely."

Meera asked, "Hum iska use logo ki help me kar sakte hain?"  
Orb: "Yes, if logic remains above all."

They realized the orb was not magic — it was a reasoning engine trained on long context data, retrieval memory, and generative logic — exactly like the system they wanted to build for the hackathon.

By sunrise, they carried the orb out of the fort. 
But the real treasure was not the library, it was the final lesson they wrote in their notebook:

"AI should read long stories, remember them, find evidence, apply logic, and answer wisely."

They walked back to Devgarh, ready to build the next generation of intelligent systems.
